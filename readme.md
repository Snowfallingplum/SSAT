# SSAT: A Symmetric Semantic-Aware Transformer Network for Makeup Transfer and Removal

This is the official  pytorch code for SSAT: A Symmetric Semantic-Aware Transformer Network for Makeup Transfer and Removal, which has been accepted by AAAI-2022. Note that only trained models and test code are provided in pytorch code.

## Latest News

Our latest paper was accepted by CVPR2024 and we will make the code publicly available at this URL（https://github.com/Snowfallingplum/CSD-MT） as soon as possible.


## Training code

We have provided the complete training code for the [MindSpore version](https://gitee.com/sunzhaoyang0304/ssat-msp) of the SSAT model.

## Example

We have provided test samples and trained models, you only need to run the "test.py"  file  and the results will be in "./results"  folder .

## How to test a custom dataset

1. Prepare face parsing. Face parsing is used in this code. In our experiment, face parsing is generated by https://github.com/zllrunning/face-parsing.PyTorch.
2. Put the results of face parsing in the .\test\seg1\makeup and \test\seg1\non-makeup
3. python test.py.
